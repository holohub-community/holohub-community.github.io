				<h2>So, what exactly does a HoloHub volunteer do?</h2>

				<p>
					<strong>
						Volunteers at HoloHub aren't your typical kind of people.
					</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					Of course, each team member has their own unique talent(s)/skill specialization
					<em>
						(which could include programming, management, moderation, video and photo editing, or simply
						being an active social media user, among other things)
					</em>
					that they use to help the community improve and grow.

				</p>

				<p>
					However, fully utilizing those specializations is dependent on the current project that the team is
					working on, and one member can effectively serve as the entire team that will handle all of the
					project's work (basically a one-man-army).
					<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
						Doing half-assed work is not an excuse given our small team size.
					</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					Depending on what the owner had in mind while eating his breakfast
					cereal, the projects can be anything from simple to impossible.
					<strong>
						<em>
							(I know, what a monsterâ€”the team's programmer).
						</em>
					</strong>

				</p>

				<p>
					We hope that this small taste of what it's like to volunteer at HoloHub will not deter you from
					joining us.
				</p>

				<p>
					We are delighted to welcome you to the HoloHub team!
